# Welcome to Concordia.Courses!

### üìö **Why Concordia.Courses?**

Concordia.Courses was born out of a shared frustration with traditional course review platforms like Rate My Professor.
As students from Concordia and McGill, we found these platforms cumbersome and lacking the depth and authenticity we 
needed to make informed decisions about our courses and professors.

Our goal is to provide an open-source, safe, straightforward, reliable, and engaging platform where Concordia students can share 
their real experiences and insights. We believe in the power of student-driven content, ensuring that the reviews 
you read are genuine and reflective of the actual classroom experience. By updating course information every semester 
and allowing users to upload grade distributions and study notes, we aim to create a comprehensive resource that evolves 
with the needs of our community.
